## Pose Estimation

This pose detection project utilizes the Mediapipe library to detect body key points in videos and images with remarkable precision. The system identifies key joints like shoulders, elbows, wrists, knees, and ankles, making it suitable for posture correction, fitness tracking, and sports analytics. It effectively handles single and multi-person scenarios, ensuring reliable tracking in diverse environments.
